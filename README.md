# Seer

Seer is a lightweight insitu wrapper library adding insitu capabilities to simulations.


## Requirements:

* CMake 3.10 or above
* C++ 11
* MPI 3
* Mochi


### Optional Requirements

* [Sensei](https://github.com/Kitware/sensei)
* [Catalyst](https://www.paraview.org/files/v5.5/Catalyst-v5.5.2-Base-Enable-Python-Essentials-Extras-Rendering-Base.tar.gz)


## Env Setup

* This project uses [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Once Spack is installed, modify (or create) packages.yaml to contain the following:

~~~bash
packages:
    libfabric:
        variants: fabrics=tcp,rxm
~~~

* Setting up Mochi and VTK

~~~bash
git clone https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/sds/sds-repo.git
spack repo add sds-repo
spack install margo
spack install sdskeyval+bdb+leveldb
spack install py-sdskv
spack install openmpi
spack install cmake
spack install vtk (spack install vtk ^hdf5+hl+mpi to bypass error) # VTK
~~~

If linking to catalyst, ParaView needs to be installed as well


## Building

The following environment needs to be activated as follows:

~~~bash
spack load -r margo
spack load -r sdskeyval

spack load paraview@5.7.0
spack load /6uyrlxs #mesa needed for ParaView without X

cd src
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..
~~~


## Running

There are two parts of running the insitu package, i) running the sim, and ii) running the client


### Env setup to run sim

~~~bash
spack load -r /ayohgie #margo
spack load -r sdskeyval

spack load paraview@5.7.0
spack load /6uyrlxs #mesa needed for ParaView
~~~

### Env setup to run python client

~~~bash
spack load -r py-sdskv
~~~


#### Launch Mochi server remotely

~~~bash
sdskv-server-daemon na+sm foo:ldb -f address &                		# for shared mem
sdskv-server-daemon ofi+tcp://192.168.101.186:1234 foo_test1:ldb &  # for distributed mem
~~~


#### Run Sim remotely

~~~bash
demoApps/testMPI na+sm://9923/0 1 foo 10                                    # shared mem
mpirun -np 4 demoApps/miniAppStructured --insitu ../inputs/input-test.json  # distributed mem
~~~


#### Jupyter

* Remote

~~~bash
module load anaconda/Anaconda3 
jupyter-notebook password                  # only needed first time
jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=8897 --ip=0.0.0.0
~~~

* Local

ssh -N -f -L port:host:hostport username@cluster e.g.

~~~bash
ssh -N -f -L 8897:cn36:8897 pascalgrosset@darwin-fe
~~~

In Browser

~~~bash
http://localhost:8897
~~~


## Adding runtime options using Mochi

Using Mochi, we can pass information to the sim while it is running. Keywords are as follows:

* Key: PAPI:ADD, Value: <PAPI_COUNTER_NAME> - add a new PAPI Counter
* Key: PAPI:DEL, Value: <PAPI_COUNTER_NAME> - remove an existing PAPI counter


## No papi counters found

* Check if papi events are around using: papi_avail | more
* Turn them on (if disabled) using: sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'
